# Lambda Codebase Robustness Plan

## Context and Analysis

### Codebase Overview
Lambda is a sophisticated document processing system with support for multiple formats including Markdown, LaTeX, and custom markup languages. The system features:
- Custom memory management with a memory pool implementation
- Multiple parsers and formatters for different document formats
- Mathematical expression processing with support for various notations
- Network and file I/O capabilities

### Key Areas of Concern

#### 1. Memory Management
- **Custom Memory Pool**: The codebase uses a custom memory pool implementation that has had buffer overflow issues in the past (e.g., `buffer_has_space()` boundary check issue)
- **Buffer Management**: Fixed-size buffer allocations with potential for overflow if not properly checked
- **Ownership Semantics**: Mixed patterns between manual memory management and RAII-style wrappers
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error recovery and cleanup in allocation failure paths
- **Thread Safety**: No explicit thread safety guarantees in memory allocation/deallocation

### Technical Details
- **Memory Pool Structure**:
  - Fixed-size blocks with free lists
  - Alignment requirements for different data types
  - Buffer boundary checking with history of off-by-one errors
- **Known Issues**:
  - Past buffer overflow in `buffer_has_space()` function
  - Potential for memory leaks in error paths
  - Inconsistent error handling patterns

#### 2. Mathematical Processing
- **Parser/Formatter Complexities**: History of subtle bugs in math expression handling, including:
  - Operator precedence issues
  - Special character handling (e.g., `?` character bug)
  - Implicit multiplication formatting
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Special handling for mathematical notations (e.g., `sum_(i=1)^n i` vs `sum_i=1^n i`)
  - Unicode and special character support
  - Handling of invalid or malformed expressions
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Potential bottlenecks in complex expression evaluation
  - Memory usage during parsing of large expressions
  - Caching strategies for frequently used expressions

### Technical Details
- **Math Parser**:
  - Supports multiple input formats (LaTeX, ASCII, MathML)
  - Handles complex expressions with nested functions and operators
  - Includes special handling for mathematical symbols and notations
- **Known Issues**:
  - Inconsistent handling of whitespace in mathematical expressions
  - Edge cases in operator precedence handling
  - Special character escaping in different output formats

#### 3. Input/Output Processing
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for various document formats (Markdown, LaTeX, HTML, etc.) with format-specific parsers and formatters
- **Network Operations**: HTTP/HTTPS client with support for:
  - HTTP/2 via nghttp2 integration
  - SSL/TLS with OpenSSL 3.5.2
  - Connection pooling and keep-alive
  - Request/response compression
- **File System**:
  - URL-based resource access (`file://`, `http://`, `https://`)
  - Caching layer for remote resources
  - Path resolution with platform-specific handling

### Technical Details
- **URL Parsing**:
  - Custom URL parser with support for multiple schemes
  - Path resolution with proper handling of `.` and `..`
  - Query parameter and fragment handling
- **HTTP Client**:
  - libcurl-based implementation
  - Support for HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1
  - Connection pooling and reuse
  - Timeout and retry logic
- **File Handling**:
  - Platform-agnostic path handling
  - File watching for live updates
  - MIME type detection

### Known Issues
- Potential path traversal vulnerabilities in file operations
- Incomplete error handling for network timeouts
- Memory usage with large file operations

#### 4. Concurrency
- **Thread Safety**:
  - Mix of thread-safe and non-thread-safe components
  - Undocumented thread safety guarantees
  - Potential for data races in shared state
- **Race Conditions**:
  - File system operations
  - Network request handling
  - Memory allocation/deallocation
- **Deadlocks**:
  - Nested locking patterns
  - I/O operations holding locks
  - Callback handling in async operations

### Technical Details
- **Threading Model**:
  - Mix of synchronous and asynchronous operations
  - Thread pool for parallel processing
  - Event loop for I/O-bound operations
- **Synchronization Primitives**:
  - Mutexes for shared resource protection
  - Condition variables for thread signaling
  - Atomic operations for lock-free patterns
- **Known Issues**:
  - Potential deadlocks in complex locking scenarios
  - Race conditions in shared resource access
  - Performance bottlenecks in highly concurrent scenarios

### Current Testing Landscape
- **Unit Tests**: Basic coverage for core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Limited coverage of component interactions
- **Fuzz Testing**: Minimal automated fuzz testing
- **Performance Testing**: No formal performance benchmarking

## Robustness Improvement Plan

## 1. Memory Safety

### Current Issues
- Custom memory pool implementation with history of buffer overflows
