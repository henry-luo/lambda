   - Integrated error reporting and statistics tracking
   - **Result**: Clear, actionable build feedback with detailed statistics

#### **‚úÖ Technical Implementation Details**

**Shared Build Functions** (`utils/build_core.sh`, `utils/build_utils.sh`):
- `build_compile_to_object()` - Unified object compilation
- `build_link_executable()` - Unified executable linking  
- `resolve_library_dependencies()` - Centralized dependency resolution
- `setup_parallel_jobs()` - Smart parallel build management

**Enhanced Test Configuration** (`build_lambda_config.json`):
```json
{
  "test": {
    "test_suites": [
      {
        "suite": "library",
        "library_dependencies": [
          ["lambda-test-minimal", "criterion"],
          ["lambda-test-extended", "criterion"]
        ],
        "binaries": ["test_strbuf.exe", "test_strview.exe", "..."]
      },
      {
        "suite": "input", 
        "library_dependencies": [
          ["lambda-test-input", "criterion"],
          ["lambda-test-input-full", "criterion"]
        ],
        "binaries": ["test_mime_detect.exe", "test_math.exe", "..."]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Smart Test Index Mapping**:
- Automatic detection of test source files within test suites
- Correct mapping to corresponding library dependencies
- Support for both basename and full path matching

#### **‚úÖ Build System Performance**

**Before Unification**:
- 4 test executables failing to build
- Manual dependency management
- Code duplication between main and test builds
- Inconsistent naming conventions

**After Unification**:
- ‚úÖ **All 13 test executables build successfully**
- ‚úÖ **98.7% test success rate** (452/458 tests passing)
- ‚úÖ **Unified build infrastructure** with shared functions
- ‚úÖ **Standardized `.exe` naming convention**
- ‚úÖ **Parallel compilation support**
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive build reporting**

#### **‚úÖ Quality Improvements**

1. **Strict Warning Compliance**: All tests build with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`
2. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Inherited platform support from main build
3. **Dependency Tracking**: Precise `.d` file tracking for incremental builds
4. **Error Diagnostics**: Enhanced error reporting with actionable guidance
5. **Build Cache**: Shared object files between main and test builds

### üßπ **Code Cleanup**

**Removed Redundant Files**:
- ‚ùå `test/test_build_enhanced.sh` (outdated version)
- ‚ùå `test/test_build_legacy.sh` (backup version)
- ‚úÖ `test/test_build.sh` (unified, working version)

**Result**: Cleaner codebase with single authoritative test build script

### **Current Analysis**

After studying the main lambda build system (`compile.sh`) and test infrastructure, I've identified significant opportunities to align and centralize the build process:

#### Main Build System Strengths (`compile.sh`)
- **Unified Configuration**: All build settings centralized in `build_lambda_config.json`
- **Library Dependency Resolution**: Sophisticated library management with nested dependencies
- **Platform Support**: Cross-compilation with platform-specific overrides
- **Incremental Building**: Advanced dependency tracking with `.d` files and header cache
- **Parallel Compilation**: Smart job management with automatic CPU detection
- **Auto-detection**: C/C++ file type detection with appropriate compiler selection
- **JSON Configuration**: Rich library definitions with sources, objects, includes, and special flags

#### ~~Current Test Build Issues~~ **[RESOLVED]** ~~(`test_build.sh`)~~
- ~~**Manual Configuration**: Test suites manually configure library dependencies in arrays~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- ~~**Fragile Dependency Resolution**: Custom logic that doesn't leverage main build system~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- ~~**Code Duplication**: Reimplements compilation logic instead of reusing compile.sh~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- ~~**Limited Platform Support**: No cross-compilation support for tests~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- ~~**Manual Object Mapping**: Hardcoded object file lists that can become stale~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**

### Enhancement Strategy

## Phase 1: Library Definition Alignment

### 1.1 Centralize Library Definitions
**Current State**: Test system has separate library dependency arrays per test
**Target State**: All library definitions in `build_lambda_config.json` with test-specific groupings

**Actions**:
- Define test-oriented library groups in main config (e.g., `lambda-test-minimal`, `lambda-test-input`)
- Add test-specific library aliases that reference main library definitions
- Create dependency resolution that inherits from main build system

**Example Enhanced Config**:
```json
{
  "libraries": [
    // ... existing main libraries ...
    {
      "name": "lambda-test-minimal",
      "description": "Minimal runtime for basic tests",
      "libraries": ["strbuf", "strview", "mem-pool"],
      "link": "inline"
    },
    {
      "name": "lambda-test-input",
      "description": "Input processing for test validation",
      "libraries": ["lambda-test-minimal", "input", "format", "mime-detect"],
      "link": "inline"
    }
  ],
  "test": {
    "test_suites": [
      {
        "suite": "library",
        "library_dependencies": [
          ["lambda-test-minimal", "criterion"],
          ["lambda-test-minimal", "criterion"],
          // ... simplified dependencies
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 1.2 Object File Auto-derivation
**Current State**: Manual object file lists in library definitions
**Target State**: Object files automatically derived from source file configuration

**Implementation**:
- Extract object file lists from main build system source files
- Use build directory scanning to verify object availability
- Auto-generate minimal object sets based on dependency analysis

## Phase 2: Build System Integration

### 2.1 Reuse Main Build Infrastructure
**Current State**: `test_build.sh` reimplements compilation logic
**Target State**: Test system delegates to main build system functions

**Actions**:
- Extract compilation functions from `compile.sh` to shared `utils/build_core.sh`
- Create test-specific wrapper that calls main build functions
- Inherit platform support, compiler detection, and optimization settings

**New Architecture**:
```
compile.sh                 # Main build entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/build_core.sh     # Shared compilation functions (NEW)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/build_utils.sh    # Shared utilities (existing)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/test_build.sh      # Test build wrapper (simplified)
```

### 2.2 Shared Configuration System
**Actions**:
- Test system reads same `build_lambda_config.json` as main build
- Test-specific settings as extensions, not replacements
- Inherit compiler, flags, warnings, and platform settings

### 2.3 Dependency Resolution Unification
**Current State**: Custom `resolve_library_dependencies()` function
**Target State**: Unified dependency resolution for both main and test builds

**Implementation**:
- Move dependency resolution to `build_core.sh`
- Support both full application builds and minimal test builds
- Handle transitive dependencies automatically

## Phase 3: Enhanced Test Configuration

### 3.1 Smart Test Suite Definition
**Current State**: Manual source/binary/dependency arrays
**Target State**: Auto-derived configurations with minimal manual specification

**Enhanced Test Suite Config**:
```json
{
  "test": {
    "compiler_inheritance": true,
    "test_suites": [
      {
        "suite": "library",
        "base_libraries": ["lambda-test-minimal"],
        "sources": ["test_strbuf.c", "test_strview.c", "test_variable_pool.c"],
        "auto_dependencies": true,
        "parallel": true
      },
      {
        "suite": "input", 
        "base_libraries": ["lambda-test-input"],
        "sources": ["test_mime_detect.c", "test_math.c"],
        "auto_dependencies": true,
        "special_requirements": ["test_context.c"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Auto-dependency Analysis
**Current State**: Manual library dependency specification per test
**Target State**: Automatic dependency analysis based on test source content

**Implementation**:
- Scan test source files for `#include` patterns to determine library needs
- Map includes to library requirements automatically
- Override system for special cases

### 3.3 Incremental Test Building
**Current State**: Basic timestamp checking
**Target State**: Full incremental building with dependency tracking

**Features**:
- Reuse `.d` file dependency tracking from main build system
- Smart recompilation based on library object changes
- Cross-dependency tracking between test and main build

## Phase 4: Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Refactor Sequence
1. **Extract Shared Functions**: Move compilation logic from `compile.sh` to `utils/build_core.sh`
2. **Enhance Config Schema**: Add test library groups to `build_lambda_config.json`
3. **Rewrite test_build.sh**: Replace custom logic with calls to shared functions
4. **Update Test Runner**: Modify `test_run.sh` to use enhanced build system
5. **Testing & Validation**: Ensure all test suites continue to work correctly

### 4.2 Backward Compatibility
- Maintain existing test suite functionality during transition
- Support both old and new configuration styles temporarily
- Gradual migration path for complex test configurations

### 4.3 Performance Improvements
- **Parallel Test Building**: Leverage main build system's parallel compilation

- Enhanced error reporting and diagnostics

## Phase 6: Enhanced Build Reporting

### 6.1 Comprehensive Build Summary
**Current State**: Basic success/failure reporting
**Target State**: Detailed build summary matching main build system quality

**Features**:
- **Error Summary with Clickable Links**: Inherit `format_diagnostics()` function from `compile.sh`
- **Build Statistics**: Files compiled, files up-to-date, linking status, dependency tracking
- **Syntax Error Navigation**: VS Code compatible file:line:column links for immediate navigation
- **Color-coded Output**: Red for errors, yellow for warnings, green for success
- **Error Categorization**: Separate display for compilation vs. linking errors

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Enhanced test build summary (similar to compile.sh)
echo -e "${YELLOW}Test Build Summary:${RESET}"
if [ "$num_errors" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo -e "${RED}Errors:   $num_errors${RESET}"
    format_test_diagnostics "ERRORS" "error:" "$RED"
else
    echo -e "Errors:   $num_errors"
fi
echo -e "${YELLOW}Warnings: $num_warnings${RESET}"
echo "Test files compiled: $test_files_compiled"
echo "Test files up-to-date: $test_files_skipped"
echo "Test suites processed: $suites_processed"
```

### 6.2 Test-Specific Error Reporting
**Enhanced Features**:
- **Test Context Errors**: Special handling for test framework compilation issues
- **Dependency Resolution Errors**: Clear reporting when test dependencies are missing
- **Library Linking Errors**: Specific guidance for missing criterion or other test libraries
- **Cross-Reference Errors**: Link test compilation errors back to main build issues

**Error Categories**:
```bash
# Test-specific error patterns
- "criterion not found" ‚Üí Suggest installation commands
- "undefined reference to lambda_*" ‚Üí Indicate missing main build objects
- "test_context.c" errors ‚Üí Point to test infrastructure issues
- Missing object files ‚Üí Suggest running 'make build' first
```
