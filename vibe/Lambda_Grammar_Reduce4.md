## Current Parser Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| File size | 10.6 MB |
| Line count | 349,123 |
| STATE_COUNT | 6,179 |
| LARGE_STATE_COUNT | 2,132 |
| SYMBOL_COUNT | 262 |
| TOKEN_COUNT | 124 |
| FIELD_COUNT | 52 |
| Conflicts | 15 |

### Size Breakdown by Section

| Section | Lines | Share |
|---------|------:|------:|
| `ts_parse_table` (large states) | 186,400 | 53.4% |
| `ts_small_parse_table` | 135,924 | 38.9% |
| `ts_lex_modes` | 6,182 | 1.8% |
| `ts_primary_state_ids` | 6,182 | 1.8% |
| `ts_parse_actions` | 5,046 | 1.4% |
| `ts_small_parse_table_map` | 4,050 | 1.2% |
| `ts_lex` | 1,925 | 0.6% |
| `ts_lex_keywords` | 731 | 0.2% |

Parse tables account for **92.3%** of the file. Each of the 2,132 large states is a dense row of 262 columns (one per symbol). The two reduction levers are: **fewer states** and **fewer symbols**.

## Original Proposals (Preserved for Reference)

## Proposal 1: Merge `binary_expr` and `attr_binary_expr`

**Impact: High (10–15% reduction)**

The `binary_expr()` helper is instantiated twice — once with all 18 operators and once without the 4 relational operators (`<`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`). This generates two independent sets of binary-precedence states. The `_attr_expr` rule exists only to route to `attr_binary_expr`.

**Current grammar:**
```js
attr_binary_expr: $ => choice(...binary_expr($, true)),
_attr_expr: $ => choice($.primary_expr, $.unary_expr, alias($.attr_binary_expr, $.binary_expr), $.if_expr, $.for_expr),
```

`_attr_expr` is used in `attr` and `element` to avoid `<`/`>` ambiguity with element tags.

**Proposed change:**
- Remove `attr_binary_expr` and `_attr_expr` entirely.
- Use `$._expr` everywhere in attr/element context.
- Validate in `build_ast.cpp` that bare relational operators don't appear in attribute value position.

**Removes:**
- 2 conflicts: `[$._attr_expr, $._expr]` and `[$.attr_binary_expr, $._expr]`
- 2 symbol IDs (`attr_binary_expr`, `_attr_expr`)
- The duplicate binary operator state fan-out

**Risk:** Low — the AST builder validation is a simple check on `binary_expr` operator field content within an `attr` parent.
### Experimental Results

All proposals below were implemented and tested. **None produced a net parser size reduction.** This section documents the findings.
#### Why Grammar-Level Restructuring Cannot Reduce This Parser

The Lambda grammar has 15 GLR conflicts representing intrinsic ambiguities:
- **Element tag ambiguity:** `<` and `>` are both element delimiters AND relational operators
- **Postfix ambiguity:** `.`, `..`, `?`, `.?` after expressions
- **Block ambiguity:** `else { ... }` could be block content or map literal
- **Type occurrence:** `T[n]` could be occurrence or end-of-type + array
- **Range vs literal:** A literal could be standalone or start of `literal to literal`

These ambiguities are **language-level** — they exist because the same tokens serve multiple purposes. Grammar restructuring can only **move** conflicts between rules, never eliminate them. Every experiment confirmed this:

| Experiment | Result | Mechanism |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Remove `attr_binary_expr`, use `$._expr` in elements | **+10% (11.6 MB)** | 3 new GLR conflicts for `<`/`>` ambiguity create more states than the duplicate binary operator approach |
| Add `_literal_expr`/`_container_expr` grouping in `primary_expr` | **Build error** | New intermediate symbols conflict with `_content_expr`'s `repeat1(string,...)` |
| Group `primary_expr` with `_value_expr`/`_access_expr` (Proposal 5, retry) | **+0.83% (+88 KB)** | Hidden rules still add symbol IDs to parse table (+2 to SYMBOL_COUNT), widening every large state row. No state reduction. Reverted. |
| Merge `match_arm_expr`/`match_arm_stam` into single rule | **+0.7% (10.7 MB)** | Internal `choice(: expr, { stam })` adds branching states |
| Inline `_content_expr` and `_expr_stam` | **+0.7% (10.7 MB)** | Inlining expands alternatives at use sites, adding states |
| Move `range_type` from `primary_type` to `_compound_type` | **Same conflict** | Shift-reduce conflict moves from `[range_type, primary_type]` to `[range_type, unary_type]` |
| Flatten Type Hierarchy (Proposal 2): remove `unary_type`, `_quantified_type`, `_compound_type`; fold into 3-layer `primary_type → _unary_type → _type_expr` | **~0% (-1 KB)** | LARGE_STATE_COUNT −89, SYMBOL_COUNT −6, but STATE_COUNT +73. Net file size unchanged. All 600/605 baseline tests pass. **Kept** — cleaner grammar, marginal improvement in large states. |
| Combine 20 `base_type` keywords into single `_base_type_kw` token | **−20.2% (−2.1 MB)** | SYMBOL_COUNT −19, TOKEN_COUNT −20, LARGE_STATE_COUNT −570. Keywords only used via `base_type` merged into one token; 4 keywords used elsewhere (`error`, `type`, `string`, `symbol`) kept separate. All 445/451 non-MIR tests pass (same 5 pre-existing failures). **Kept.** |
| Merge `match_arm_expr`/`match_arm_stam` + `match_default_expr`/`match_default_stam` into `match_arm`/`match_default` (Proposal 8) | **−0.02% (−2 KB)** | SYMBOL_COUNT −2 (237→235). STATE_COUNT, LARGE_STATE_COUNT unchanged. Each merged rule uses `choice(: expr, { stmts })` body. Cleaner grammar, trivial size gain. All tests pass. **Kept.** |
#### Key Insight

The `attr_binary_expr` + `_attr_expr` design is the **optimal grammar-level solution** for the `<`/`>` element ambiguity. It statically excludes relational operators from element context without GLR overhead. The cost is 14 duplicate binary operator states — but the alternative (GLR conflicts) costs 330+ additional large states.

Tree-sitter's LALR/GLR state count is determined by **token-level lookahead**, not rule-level structure. Restructuring rules (merging, inlining, flattening) changes the rule graph but not the set of tokens valid at each parse position, so state count stays the same or increases.
#### Viable Paths Forward (Require Language/Architecture Changes)

1. **External scanner for element `>`** — A C scanner tracking element nesting could tokenize `>` differently inside elements, eliminating `attr_binary_expr`. Requires new `scanner.c` infrastructure.

2. **Element syntax change** — Using explicit close tags (`<div>...</div>`) or different delimiters would eliminate the `<`/`>` ambiguity entirely.

3. **Parser compression** — Post-process `parser.c` to compress the parse tables (run-length encoding, shared row deduplication). This is a build-tool change, not a grammar change.

4. **Tree-sitter version upgrade** — Newer tree-sitter versions may have better state merging or table compression.

## Proposal 2: Flatten Type Expression Hierarchy — APPLIED ✓

**Original estimate: High (10–15% reduction)**

The type system originally had 7 structural layers:

```
primary_type → unary_type → _quantified_type → occurrence_type / concat_type / constrained_type
    → _compound_type → binary_type → _type_expr (+ error_union_type)
```

**Applied change:** Flattened to 3 layers:

```
primary_type → unary_type (occurrence) → _type_expr (binary/concat/constrained/error)
```

Specific changes made:
- **Removed `unary_type` named rule** — folded `negation_type` into `primary_type` directly; renamed hidden `_unary_type` to visible `unary_type` as `choice(occurrence_type, primary_type)`
- **Removed `_quantified_type`** — `occurrence_type` and `primary_type` now grouped under `unary_type`
- **Removed `_compound_type`** — `constrained_type` and `concat_type` moved directly into `_type_expr`
- Updated `occurrence_type` operand from `$.unary_type` to `$.primary_type`
- Updated `constrained_type` base from `$._quantified_type` to `$.unary_type`
- Updated `concat_type` terms from `$._quantified_type` to `$.unary_type`
- Updated 3 conflicts and precedence declarations
- Removed dead `sym_unary_type` case from `build_ast.cpp`, added pass-through handler for new visible `unary_type` node

### Results

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| File size | 10,608,627 B | 10,607,520 B | **−1,107 B (~0%)** |
| STATE_COUNT | 6,179 | 6,252 | +73 |
| LARGE_STATE_COUNT | 2,132 | 2,043 | **−89** |
| SYMBOL_COUNT | 262 | 256 | **−6** |
| Baseline tests | 600/605 | 600/605 | No change |

**Verdict: Kept.** The net file size is essentially unchanged, but the grammar is cleaner with 6 fewer symbols, 89 fewer large states, and 4 fewer intermediate rules. The original 10–15% estimate was wrong — the type hierarchy layers were not the main driver of state count. The improvement comes from fewer symbols (smaller dense rows in large states) offsetting the slightly higher total state count.

---

## Proposal 3: Unify Expression/Statement Duals

**Impact: Medium-High (5–8% reduction)**

Six conflicts arise from expression-vs-statement ambiguity inside `else { ... }` blocks:

| Expr form | Stam form | Conflict |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| `let_expr` | `let_stam` | `[$.let_expr, $.let_stam]` |
| `raise_expr` | `raise_stam` | `[$.raise_expr, $.raise_stam]` |
| — | — | `[$._statement, $._expr]` |
| — | — | `[$._attr_expr, $._expr]` |

The only difference between `let_expr` and `let_stam` is that `let_stam` allows trailing `, declare` for multi-assignment. Similarly, `raise_expr` and `raise_stam` differ only in the optional `;`.

**Proposed change:**
- Unify `let_expr` / `let_stam` into a single `let_expr` that optionally takes trailing `, assign_expr`. The AST builder distinguishes single-let (expression) from multi-let (statement) by child count.
- Unify `raise_expr` / `raise_stam` into a single `raise_expr`. Handle `;` as optional at the statement boundary (already done for `break_stam`, `continue_stam`, `return_stam`).

**Removes:** 2 conflicts and the GLR fork path duplication for every `else {` block.

**Risk:** Low — the AST builder already processes both and can distinguish by child structure.

---

## Proposal 4: Strategic `inline` Additions

**Impact: Medium (3–5% reduction)**

Currently 5 rules are inlined: `_non_null_literal`, `_parenthesized_expr`, `_arguments`, `_number`, `_datetime`. Adding more intermediate rules to `inline` prevents them from creating their own symbol IDs, reducing SYMBOL_COUNT and its multiplicative effect on large state rows.

**Candidates (used in 1–2 places):**

| Rule | Used in | Benefit |
|------|---------|---------|
| `_content_expr` | `content`, `_statement` | Remove 1 symbol |
| `_expr_stam` | `_content_expr` only | Remove 1 symbol |
| `_compound_type` | `_type_expr` only | Remove 1 symbol (if Proposal 2 not applied) |
| `_quantified_type` | `_compound_type` only | Remove 1 symbol (if Proposal 2 not applied) |

**Caution:** Over-inlining rules used in many parents can *increase* states. Apply only to rules used in ≤2 contexts.

**Risk:** Low — these are hidden rules; inlining is invisible to consumers.

---

## Proposal 5: Group `primary_expr` Alternatives

**Impact: Medium (5–10% reduction)**

`primary_expr` has **27 alternatives**. Every token that could begin a primary expression forces the parser to consider all 27 in every expression-expecting state. This directly drives the large state count (2,132 large states).

**Proposed change:** Introduce intermediate hidden grouping rules:

```js
_literal_expr: $ => choice(
  $._number, $._datetime, $.string, $.symbol, $.binary,
  $.true, $.false, $.inf, $.nan,
),

_container_expr: $ => choice(
  $.list, $.array, $.map, $.element, $.object_literal,
),

primary_expr: $ => prec(50, choice(
  $._literal_expr,
  $._container_expr,
  $.base_type,
  $.identifier,
  $.index_expr,
  $.path_expr,
  $.member_expr,
  $.parent_expr,
  $.call_expr,
  $.query_expr,
  $.direct_query_expr,
  $._parenthesized_expr,
  $.fn_expr,
  $.current_item,
  $.current_index,
  $.variadic,
)),
```

Do **not** inline these grouping rules — they intentionally reduce fan-out by collapsing related tokens into shared state transitions.

**Risk:** Low — no semantic change. Verify with `make test-lambda-baseline`.

---

## Proposal 6: Merge For-Loop Clause Rules

**Impact: Low-Medium (2–3% reduction)**

The `for` comprehension uses 9 symbols: `for_where_clause`, `for_order_clause`, `for_group_clause`, `for_limit_clause`, `for_offset_clause`, `for_clauses`, `order_spec`, `loop_expr`, `for_let_clause`.

**Proposed change:** Merge the 5 clause rules into `for_clauses` directly:

```js
for_clauses: $ => repeat1(choice(
  seq('where', field('cond', $._expr)),
  seq('group', 'by', field('key', $._expr), repeat(seq(',', field('key', $._expr))), 'as', field('name', $.identifier)),
  seq('order', 'by', field('spec', seq($._expr, optional(choice('asc', 'desc')))),
      repeat(seq(',', field('spec', seq($._expr, optional(choice('asc', 'desc'))))))),
  seq('limit', field('count', $._expr)),
  seq('offset', field('count', $._expr)),
)),
```

The AST builder can distinguish clause kinds by their keyword.

**Removes:** 5 symbol IDs, ~4 named rule reductions.

**Risk:** Low — only affects for-loop internals. The AST builder already walks children.

---

## Proposal 7: Consolidate Access Expressions — PARTIALLY APPLIED ✓

**Original estimate: Low-Medium (2–4% reduction)**

`path_expr`, `member_expr`, `parent_expr`, `query_expr`, and `direct_query_expr` all handle access operations. They generate 4 conflicts with `$._expr`:

```
[$._expr, $.member_expr]
[$._expr, $.parent_expr]
[$._expr, $.query_expr]
[$._expr, $.direct_query_expr]
```

### Conservative Approach Applied

Merging all 5 into one `access_expr` was too risky — `member_expr` is referenced in `assign_expr` targets, and `path_expr`/`parent_expr` have fundamentally different structures. Instead, only `query_expr` and `direct_query_expr` were merged since they have identical structure except for the operator (`?` vs `.?`):

```js
query_expr: $ => seq(
  field('object', $.primary_expr),
  field('op', choice('?', '.?')),
  field('query', $.primary_type),
),
```

The AST builder determines direct vs recursive from the `op` field length:
```cpp
TSNode op_node = ts_node_child_by_field_id(child, FIELD_OP);
StrView op = ts_node_source(tp, op_node);
query_node->direct = (op.length == 2);  // ".?" = direct, "?" = recursive
```

Conflicts reduced from 4 to 3 (two query conflicts → one).

### Results

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| File size | 8,480,465 B | 8,399,363 B | **−81,102 B (−0.96%)** |
| STATE_COUNT | 6,264 | 6,241 | **−23** |
| LARGE_STATE_COUNT | 1,482 | 1,480 | **−2** |
| SYMBOL_COUNT | 235 | 234 | **−1** |
| TOKEN_COUNT | 104 | 104 | No change |
| Non-MIR tests | 450/451 | 450/451 | No change |

**Verdict: Kept.** Modest size reduction but cleaner grammar — two nearly-identical rules consolidated into one.

---

## Proposal 8: Merge Match Arm Forms — APPLIED ✓

**Original estimate: Low (1–2% reduction)**

`match_expr` had 4 arm types: `match_arm_expr`, `match_arm_stam`, `match_default_expr`, `match_default_stam`.

### Applied Change

Merged into 2 rules using `choice()` for the body form:

```js
match_arm: $ => seq('case', field('pattern', $._type_expr),
  choice(seq(':', field('body', $._expr)), seq('{', field('body', $.content), '}'))
),
match_default: $ => seq('default',
  choice(seq(':', field('body', $._expr)), seq('{', field('body', $.content), '}'))
),
```

### Results

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| File size | 8,482,463 B | 8,480,465 B | **−1,998 B (−0.02%)** |
| STATE_COUNT | 6,264 | 6,264 | No change |
| LARGE_STATE_COUNT | 1,482 | 1,482 | No change |
| SYMBOL_COUNT | 237 | 235 | **−2** |
| TOKEN_COUNT | 104 | 104 | No change |
| Non-MIR tests | 450/451 | 450/451 | No change |

**Verdict: Kept.** Minimal size impact but cleaner grammar — 4 near-identical rules reduced to 2.

---

## Proposal 9: Reduce `base_type` Keywords — APPLIED ✓ (via token consolidation)

**Original estimate: Low (1–2% reduction)**
**Actual result: −20.2% (−2.1 MB) — the largest single improvement**

The original proposal suggested removing 5 rarely-used keywords from `base_type`. Instead, a more effective approach was found: consolidating 20 of the 24 `base_type` keywords into a single `token()` rule.

### Analysis

`base_type` had 24 keyword alternatives. Each keyword created its own anonymous terminal symbol (`anon_sym_null`, `anon_sym_int`, etc.), adding 24 columns to every large state row.

4 keywords are also used as standalone string literals elsewhere in the grammar:
- `'error'` — in `error_type_pattern`
- `'type'` — in `type_stam`, `entity_type`, `object_type`, `pub_stam`
- `'string'` — in `string_pattern`
- `'symbol'` — in `symbol_pattern`

These 4 must remain separate. The other 20 (`null`, `any`, `bool`, `int64`, `int`, `float`, `decimal`, `number`, `datetime`, `date`, `time`, `binary`, `range`, `list`, `array`, `map`, `element`, `entity`, `object`, `function`) are ONLY referenced through `base_type`.

### Applied Change

```js
// New: single token for 20 keywords only used via base_type
_base_type_kw: _ => token(prec(1, choice(
  'null', 'any', 'bool', 'int64', 'int', 'float', 'decimal', 'number',
  'datetime', 'date', 'time', 'binary', 'range',
  'list', 'array', 'map', 'element', 'entity', 'object', 'function'
))),

// base_type now uses the combined token + 4 standalone keywords
base_type: $ => prec(1, choice(
  $._base_type_kw,
  'error', 'type', 'string', 'symbol'
)),
```

No changes needed in `build_ast.cpp` — the AST builder reads the text content of the `base_type` node via `ts_node_source()`, which returns the same keyword string regardless of whether it came from `_base_type_kw` or individual anonymous symbols.

### Results

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| File size | 10,631,709 B | 8,482,463 B | **−2,149,246 B (−20.2%)** |
| STATE_COUNT | 6,265 | 6,264 | −1 |
| LARGE_STATE_COUNT | 2,052 | 1,482 | **−570** |
| SYMBOL_COUNT | 256 | 237 | **−19** |
| TOKEN_COUNT | 124 | 104 | **−20** |
| Non-MIR tests | 445/451 | 445/451 | No change (same 5 pre-existing) |

**Verdict: Kept.** The 19 fewer symbol columns removed from each of the 2,052 large state rows dramatically shrinks the dense `ts_parse_table`. 570 states dropped below the large-state threshold and moved to the compact `ts_small_parse_table` representation.

### Key Insight

Token consolidation is the most effective parser reduction technique found. Each symbol ID eliminated removes one column from every large state row — a multiplicative effect. Combining N keywords that share a single grammar role into one `token()` rule removes N−1 symbols at no cost to parsing correctness.

---

## Proposal 10: Merge `string_pattern`/`symbol_pattern` into `type_stam` — APPLIED ✓

**Impact: Low (−0.28%)**

`string_pattern` and `symbol_pattern` were standalone grammar rules with identical structure to `type_stam` (via `type_assign`):

```js
// Before: 3 separate rules
type_stam:      'type'   identifier = _type_expr
string_pattern: 'string' identifier = _type_expr
symbol_pattern: 'symbol' identifier = _type_expr
```

### Applied Change

Merged all three into `type_stam` by parameterizing the leading keyword:

```js
type_stam: $ => seq(
  field('kind', choice('type', 'string', 'symbol')),
  field('declare', alias($.type_assign, $.assign_expr)),
  repeat(seq(',', field('declare', alias($.type_assign, $.assign_expr))))
),
```

Removed `string_pattern` and `symbol_pattern` rules and their references in `_expr_stam`.

**AST builder changes:**
- `build_let_and_type_stam` now reads the `kind` field text via `ts_node_source()`. If `"string"` or `"symbol"`, routes to `build_string_pattern` instead of `build_assign_expr`.
- `build_string_pattern` updated to read `FIELD_AS` (from `type_assign`) with fallback to `FIELD_PATTERN`.
- Removed `SYM_STRING_PATTERN` and `SYM_SYMBOL_PATTERN` macros from `ast.hpp` and their `case` branches from `build_expr`.

### Results

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| File size | 8,399,363 B | 8,375,586 B | **−23,777 B (−0.28%)** |
| STATE_COUNT | 6,241 | 6,226 | −15 |
| LARGE_STATE_COUNT | 1,480 | 1,480 | No change |
| SYMBOL_COUNT | 234 | 232 | **−2** |
| TOKEN_COUNT | 104 | 104 | No change |
| Tests | 450/451 | **605/605** | All pass |

**Verdict: Kept.** Modest size reduction (−24 KB, −2 symbols). Cleaner grammar — three near-identical rules consolidated into one. Also eliminates `'string'` and `'symbol'` as standalone anonymous keywords, which is a prerequisite for potentially merging them into `_base_type_kw` in the future.
