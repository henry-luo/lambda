= AsciiDoc Comprehensive Feature Test

This is a comprehensive test document for the AsciiDoc parser implementation in the new unified markup parser. It tests all implemented features to ensure complete compatibility and functionality.

== Document Structure & Headers

AsciiDoc supports six levels of headers using equal signs (=).

=== Level 3 Header
This is a level 3 header section.

==== Level 4 Header  
This is a level 4 header section.

===== Level 5 Header
This is a level 5 header section.

====== Level 6 Header
This is a level 6 header section.

== Inline Formatting

AsciiDoc supports various inline formatting options:

=== Bold and Italic Text
- This is *bold text* using asterisks
- This is _italic text_ using underscores  
- You can combine *bold* and _italic_ text in the same paragraph
- Multiple *bold words* and _italic phrases_ in one sentence

=== Inline Code
- Single `backticks` create inline code
- Code like `printf("Hello, World!")` is properly formatted
- Variables like `int counter = 0` are highlighted
- File paths like `/usr/local/bin` are monospaced

=== Hyperlinks and URLs
- Direct URLs are auto-linked: https://github.com
- HTTP links work too: http://example.com
- HTTPS protocol: https://www.google.com
- FTP links: ftp://files.example.com

== Lists

AsciiDoc supports unordered lists using asterisks:

=== Simple List
* First item in list
* Second item in list
* Third item with *bold formatting*
* Fourth item with _italic text_
* Fifth item with `inline code`

=== List with Mixed Content
* Item with https://example.com link
* Item with *bold* and _italic_ text
* Item with `code snippets` and formatting
* Item with multiple https://github.com and http://test.com links

== Code Blocks

AsciiDoc supports code blocks using four dashes:

=== Python Code Block
----
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return "success"

# This is a comment
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Iteration: {i}")
----

=== JavaScript Code Block  
----
function greetUser(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    return true;
}

// Example usage
greetUser("AsciiDoc");
const result = greetUser("Parser");
----

=== Configuration Example
----
# Application Configuration
server.port=8080
database.host=localhost
database.name=myapp
logging.level=INFO
----

== Admonitions

AsciiDoc supports five types of admonitions for important information:

=== Note Admonition
NOTE: This is a note admonition. It provides additional information that might be helpful to readers.

=== Tip Admonition
TIP: This is a tip admonition. It offers helpful advice or shortcuts for users.

=== Important Admonition  
IMPORTANT: This is an important admonition. It highlights critical information that users must not overlook.

=== Warning Admonition
WARNING: This is a warning admonition. It alerts users about potential issues or dangers.

=== Caution Admonition
CAUTION: This is a caution admonition. It advises users to proceed carefully to avoid problems.

== Tables

AsciiDoc supports table formatting using pipe symbols and equal signs:

=== Simple Data Table
|===
|Name |Age |City |Country

|Alice |28 |New York |USA
|Bob |34 |London |UK  
|Charlie |25 |Tokyo |Japan
|Diana |31 |Sydney |Australia
|Eve |29 |Toronto |Canada
|===

=== Table with Mixed Content
|===
|Feature |Status |Description |Priority

|*Headers* |✓ |All six header levels |High
|_Lists_ |✓ |Unordered lists with asterisks |High
|`Code Blocks` |✓ |Four-dash delimited blocks |Medium
|Admonitions |✓ |NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, WARNING, CAUTION |Medium
|https://example.com |✓ |URL auto-linking |Low

|Pro Plan |$25/month |All features + _premium support_ |⭐⭐⭐⭐
|Enterprise |$100/month |Everything + `API access` |⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
|Custom |Contact Sales |Tailored solutions |Varies

== Complex Mixed Content

This section demonstrates complex combinations of formatting:

=== Rich Text Paragraph
This paragraph contains *bold text*, _italic text_, and `inline code`. It also includes links to https://asciidoc.org and http://github.com. The combination of **multiple bold** and __italic formatting__ with `code snippets` creates rich, readable content.

=== Feature List with Complex Items
* *Bold header*: This item starts with bold text and includes _italic emphasis_ 
* _Italic header_: This item has `code examples` like `git commit -m "message"`
* `Code header`: Links to https://docs.github.com and https://git-scm.com
* Mixed content: *Bold*, _italic_, `code`, and https://example.com all together

=== Multi-line Admonitions
NOTE: This is a comprehensive note that spans multiple concepts. It demonstrates that admonitions can contain *bold text*, _italic text_, `inline code`, and even links like https://asciidoc.org for additional reference material.

TIP: Pro tip for developers: When writing AsciiDoc, you can combine `git commit` commands with *proper formatting* and reference documentation at https://git-scm.com/docs for the most _effective_ workflow.

== Conclusion

This comprehensive test document validates all implemented AsciiDoc features:

* ✅ Document structure with proper metadata
* ✅ Six levels of headers (= to ======)  
* ✅ Inline formatting: *bold*, _italic_, `code`
* ✅ URL auto-linking: https:// and http:// protocols
* ✅ Unordered lists with asterisk bullets
* ✅ Code blocks with four-dash delimiters (----)
* ✅ Five admonition types: NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, WARNING, CAUTION
* ✅ Tables with pipe delimiter syntax (|===)
* ✅ Complex mixed content combinations
* ✅ Proper parsing and element generation

The unified markup parser successfully handles all these AsciiDoc features with full compatibility and generates the expected HTML-like element structure for further processing.

=== Final Notes

IMPORTANT: This test file serves as both a validation tool and a reference for the complete AsciiDoc feature set supported by the new unified markup parser implementation.
