# Welcome to MDX

This is a simple MDX document that combines **Markdown** and JSX.

<Button variant="primary">Click me!</Button>

## Features

- Markdown syntax works normally
- JSX components are embedded seamlessly
- Code blocks still work:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, MDX!";
```

<Alert type="info">
  This is a JSX component with children content.
</Alert>

The end.
