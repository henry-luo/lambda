# Radiant online page inventory

`pages.csv` is the shared URL list used by `test_radiant_online_view_gtest` and
the snapshot capture script. Its columns are the case label, page URL, and
whether the online-view smoke test expects linked resources.

From the repository root, run:

```sh
node test/online/capture_snapshots.cjs
```

The script saves matching 1200 × 800 Lambda and Chromium PNGs under
`test/online/snapshots/`. It also writes `capture_results.csv` there. Set
`CHROME_HEADLESS_SHELL` to select a specific Puppeteer headless shell, or set
`RADIANT_ONLINE_CAPTURE_JOBS` to change the default four concurrent page cases.
`RADIANT_ONLINE_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT_MS` and `RADIANT_ONLINE_RENDER_TIMEOUT_MS`
override browser navigation and Lambda render timeouts.

`test_page_load_gtest` writes its local fixture timing and memory measurements
to `page_load_metrics.csv` in this directory.
