            <step number="3">In a bowl, whisk together eggs, grated parmesan, and black pepper.</step>
            <step number="4">Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup of pasta water.</step>
            <step number="5">Add hot pasta to the skillet with pancetta and toss.</step>
            <step number="6">Remove from heat and quickly stir in egg mixture, adding pasta water as needed.</step>

        <notes>
            The key is to work quickly when adding the eggs to prevent them from scrambling.
            The residual heat will cook the eggs just enough to create a creamy sauce.
