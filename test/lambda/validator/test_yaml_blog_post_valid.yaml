  # Introduction to Lambda Validators
  
  Lambda validators provide a powerful and flexible way to validate data structures
  across multiple formats including JSON, XML, YAML, and more. In this comprehensive
  guide, we'll explore the core concepts and practical applications.
  
  ## Core Features
  
  1. **Multi-format Support**: JSON, XML, YAML, HTML, Markdown
  2. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with union types and optional fields
  3. **Nested Validation**: Complex nested structures with recursive support
  4. **Performance**: Optimized validation with minimal overhead
  
  ## Getting Started
  
  To begin using Lambda validators in your project, you'll need to define schemas
  that describe your expected data structure. These schemas use a simple syntax
  that's both human-readable and machine-parseable.
