					<h2>Etymology</h2>
					<p>
						The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to
						be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning
						of the 6th century. It was suggested that the word 'cattus' is
						derived from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, "tomcat", or
						its feminine form suffixed with -t. The Late Latin word may be
						derived from another Afro-Asiatic or Nilo-Saharan language. The
						Nubian word kaddîska "wildcat" and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources
						or cognates. The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~
						قِطّ qiṭṭ. It is "equally likely that the forms might derive from an
						ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and
						to Syriac and Arabic".
					</p>
					<div class="etymology-inside-duo">
						<p class="text-italic">
							The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from
							the 16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch poes or
							from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or
							Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė
							and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology of this word is
							unknown, but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to
							attract a cat.

					<h2>Life span</h2>
					<p>
						Reliable information on the lifespans of domestic cats is varied and
						limited. Nevertheless, a number of studies have investigated the
						matter and have come up with noteworthy estimates. The average
						lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades. In the early
						1980s, it was about seven years, rising to 9.4 years in 1995 and
						about 15 years in 2021. Some cats have been reported as surviving
						into their 30s, with the oldest known cat, Creme Puff, dying at a
						age of 38. Neutering increases life expectancy: one study found
						castrated male cats live twice as long as intact males, while spayed
						female cats live 62% longer than intact females. The life expectancy
						of a cat that is living indoors is typically about 16.9 years, while
						the life expectancy of one living outdoors is 5.6 years.

					<h2>Superstition</h2>
					<p>
						Many cultures have negative superstitions about cats. An example
						would be the belief that encountering a black cat ("crossing one's
						path") leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' familiars used
						to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in
						Medieval Ypres, Belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous
						present-day Kattenstoet (cat parade). In mid-16th century France,
						cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment. According to
						Norman Davies, the assembled people "shrieked with laughter as the
						animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally
						carbonized".
